				<p>Below you'll find links to and descriptions of my personal and academic coding projects.</p>
				<h2><li><a href="https://github.com/MichaelBonnet/TeamZephyr">Network Exploitation Drone</a></li></h2>
				<p>Currently developing a Software Defined Radio sensor payload for a commercial drone that locates, scans, and attempts to exploit open WiFi Access Points. The sensor payload reads angular and frequency data from different geographic points reached by moving the drone, then transmits that data to a base station that triangulates and maps the position of the RF emitter based on data from the sensor payload.</p> 
				<p>After locating and moving within range of the access point, An operator at the base station remotely executes an nmap scan of the open network via the payload's onboard computer and attempts to exploit vulnerabilities on the network.</p>
				<p>I am the team leader and scrum master on the project, and work primarily on the communications and control aspects of the project.</p>
				<p>This project earned sponsorship from Elbit Systems of America, who provided some design specifications as well as funding.</p>
